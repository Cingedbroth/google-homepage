6-30-18: Work in progress. I understand all the basics of css and HTML, I am just having a hard time retaining & utilizing them. I'm finding that I am throwing something in and then seeing what happens, but with having to go through the add/commit/push to git to refresh and see the change that is a bit of work. I have been searching through the dev tools in chrome to make changes there, and have become more comfortable with using it, but I'm still not a at a point I feel like a have a working knowledge of this project. At this point I am going to continue on and will come back later to prevent procrastination/dread.
